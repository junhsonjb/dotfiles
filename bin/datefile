# datefile: create a file named after the necessary date
#
# I name weekly reviews based on the date of the monday for that week. Monthly reviews
# are named for that month. This script saves me from:
# - checking the date for the week I'm about to record
# - typing it out
# - copying the template into the newly created file (or just doing a cp with the filename)
#
# It's a small script, but still super helpful. And good for getting into the habit of 
# noticing and fixing workflow bugs!

# TODO:
# - use the script and take note of any deficiencies, then we can modify if needed
# - until then, congrats -- you did it!
