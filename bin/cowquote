# quote: print (mostly) sit-com quotes to the screen for fun
#
# A fun utility I wrote to work on my script-writing chops. I often manually pass funny quotes
# into cowsay to serve as "screensavers" on terminal windows or tmux panes. This way, when I switch
# on to them, I get a fun little kick. This was a fun way to automate the process and spice things
# up.
